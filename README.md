Angry Birds Clone
<li>
I used Swift's Spritekit framework while developing this project.
I provided the background image , bird image , box image and enemy image I used in the game from operngameart.org.
After adding physics bodies to the bird, box and enemy in the game, I defined their properties such as gravity effect and mass.
After making these definitions, I ensured that the scorelabel increased by 1 for each collision.
Finally, after adding the functions of pulling and releasing the bird, I completed my work by performing operational tests of the application.
